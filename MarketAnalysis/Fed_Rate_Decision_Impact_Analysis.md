## Fed Commentary Analysis

**Key Powell Quotes:**
> "The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run."

**Translation**: Data-dependent approach continues, not committed to cutting cycle.

**Dot Plot Insights:**
- 2024: 2 more cuts expected (50 bps total)
- 2025: 100 bps of cuts projected
- Terminal rate: 3.00% - 3.25% by end 2026

## Historical Context

Previous rate cut cycles initial market performance:
- 2019 (Insurance cuts): +8% in 3 months
- 2007 (Recession cuts): -15% in 3 months
- 2001 (Bubble burst): -20% in 3 months

Current setup most resembles 2019 "insurance" scenario.
