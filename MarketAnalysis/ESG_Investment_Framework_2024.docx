1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

DataVault's ESG Investment Framework represents our commitment to sustainable investing while delivering superior risk-adjusted returns. This document outlines our comprehensive approach to integrating environmental, social, and governance factors into our investment process.

• 92% of portfolios integrate ESG factors

2. ESG INTEGRATION PHILOSOPHY

Our Approach:
We believe that companies with strong ESG practices are better positioned for long-term success. ESG integration is not about sacrificing returns—it's about identifying risks and opportunities that traditional financial analysis might miss.

Core Principles:
→ Materiality Focus: Concentrate on ESG factors most relevant to financial performance
→ Active Ownership: Engage with companies to improve ESG practices
→ Transparency: Clear reporting on ESG metrics and outcomes
→ Continuous Improvement: Evolve methodology based on best practices

Integration Levels:

Level 1 - Screening (All Portfolios):
• Exclude controversial weapons manufacturers
• Exclude tobacco producers
• Exclude thermal coal (>30% revenue)
• Exclude severe ESG controversy companies

Level 2 - Integration (Select Portfolios):
• ESG scoring overlay on security selection
• Risk-adjusted return optimization
• Thematic tilts (clean energy, water, health)
• Best-in-class selection within sectors

Level 3 - Impact (Dedicated Strategies):
• Direct impact measurement
• SDG alignment reporting
• Positive screening only
• Engagement priority list
