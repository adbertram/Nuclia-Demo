# DataVault Enterprise Code Samples
## Article 3: Scaling Intelligence Across the Enterprise

These code samples demonstrate how DataVault Financial Services scaled their Nuclia implementation to enterprise level, handling 10 million documents across multiple regions with role-based access control.

## Setup

1. Copy `.env.template` to `.env` and add your Nuclia API key
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run individual scripts to see each component in action

## Code Samples

### 1. Enterprise Knowledge Manager (`enterprise_knowledge_manager.py`)
**Author:** David Kim  
Implements multi-tenant knowledge box architecture with federated search across different business units and regions.

```bash
python enterprise_knowledge_manager.py
```

### 2. Secure Access Manager (`secure_access_manager.py`)
**Authors:** Sarah Rodriguez & David Kim  
Role-based access control system with comprehensive audit logging for compliance.

```bash
python secure_access_manager.py
```

### 3. Multi-Modal Processor (`multimodal_processor.py`)
**Author:** Lisa Thompson  
Processes earnings calls, financial charts, and multi-format documents for comprehensive intelligence extraction.

```bash
python multimodal_processor.py
```

### 4. Intelligent Report Generator (`intelligent_report_generator.py`)
**Author:** Lisa Thompson  
AI-powered report generation that reduced report creation time from 5 days to 15 minutes.

```bash
python intelligent_report_generator.py
```

### 5. Cost Optimization Manager (`cost_optimization_manager.py`)
**Author:** Sarah Rodriguez  
Reduces Nuclia costs by 60% through intelligent indexing, deduplication, and caching strategies.
